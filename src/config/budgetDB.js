// This file is responsible for setting up the connection to the PostgreSQL database 
// using Prisma Client. It exports functions to connect and disconnect from the database, 
// as well as the Prisma Client instance itself for use in other parts of the application. 
// The connection string is read from the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`,
//  and error handling is implemented to ensure that any issues with the database connection are logged 
// and handled gracefully.
// This part was a b*tch :)
